# Happy Cows 4

For this project, I have implemented the Best-First Search algorithm on the Happy Cows Framework (See happy cows 1)

This search is attempting to place the same number of cows as haystacks, and to
achieve a minimum score of 12 for the field

run.sh takes an input and output file test.sh takes only a grid size test.sh will generate 5 random grids of the given size and print their solutions Not every random grid will have a solution, so after attempting all possible placements it will print "Failed!" and move on to the next test
